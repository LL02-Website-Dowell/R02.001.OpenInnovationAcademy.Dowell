Dowell hackathon ideation phase 1.0 is coming to a close and closer to reaching logic 1.1. 
The second review of ideation is now on. The first review already has shown the extremely competitive nature of the teams with two of the best coming on top. 
The toppers exhibited a lot of understanding and smartness in putting forward new ideas to this phase. 
The mentors deserve special mention for the way they guided the participants, clarifying different technical issues and thereby ensuring smooth conduct of this round.
The judges are going through all the additions from the participants and final scores are getting tabulated and score cards should be out soo. 
The winners will be announced soon after that.  
We are expecting to launch ideation for phase 1.2 as soon this is over.
